STEP 2: Now I have selected S3 service, I will create a unique bucket by clicking on create bucket button on the page. This step explains that the bucket name we have to provide it must be “Unique”, will not contain any “Upper case letters” and also “Special characters” are not allowed. If you type any of these it will display the error that this bucket can not be created as shown in the image below.

Now coming to the region selection, we can select region according to the region that is available on the list. Usually for cloud services always prefer the region that is nearby to your location to make services highly available. In this lab, I have selected Sydney as it is nearby my country New Zealand. While creating a bucket name remember to provide a unique name with no special characters, no upper case letters.

STEP 3: Now I have uploaded some files into the bucket that I have just now created. There is no such kind of restriction on uploading the file. The only restriction is that size of uploading a single file must be with the size fewer than 5 terabytes.
